# hsuScript

hsuScript is a low-level programming language compiler built in C.

The name is an homage to my old high school computer science teacher, Mr. Hsu.

Very nice guy definitely didn't do anything bad during his teaching career at Lake Park High School....

This is just a fun project to help me develop a better understanding of the inner workings of compilers and interpreters. BONUS: I get better at C!

But please feel free to flex on me by forking this repo and building "the next best low-level programming language"! >:P
