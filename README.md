# hsuScript

hsuScript is an homage to my old computer science teacher Mr. Hsu 
Very nice guy definitely didn't do anything bad during his during his teaching career at Lake Park High School....

This is not an attempt to make the next best low level language just a fun project to help me get better at low level programming
in C and better understand the inner working of compilers and interpreters.
